{Subject: DJ booking inquiry: Saumac @ [Event Name]}

Hello [Name],

I hope you’re doing well.

I’ve been following the events at [Event Name] for some time and really appreciate the direction you’re taking, especially the way you support cool, emerging artists and curate lineups with a strong identity and forward-thinking energy. It’s an approach I genuinely respect and feel aligned with.

My name is Saumac, a Belgian DJ and producer. I would describe my sound as hypnotic, blending energetic, driving deep techno with groove-focused nuances, always aiming to create immersive sets built around rhythm, tension, and momentum. I’m reaching out to introduce myself and share my work, as I’d love to be considered for future lineups at [Event Name].

Over the past years, I’ve gained solid experience performing across London and Paris, playing venues such as Night Tales, The Steel Yard, Gallery Club, Palais de Tokyo, and Nouveau Casino, where I’ve developed a precise and high-energy approach behind the decks.

I’ve attached my press kit, which includes my bio, music, and relevant links. You’ll also find my SoundCloud and social media below for easy access.

Thank you very much for your time and for the work you do in pushing forward exciting artists and events. I’d be happy to provide any additional information if needed, and I’d also be glad to connect or meet in person to talk whenever the opportunity comes up.

Best regards,

Saumac
