Hey [Name] — hope you’re well. I’ve been following [Event Name] for a while and really respect the direction and artists you’re curating.
I’m Saumac, a Belgian DJ & producer playing hypnotic, groove-driven deep techno. I’ve played venues like Night Tales, The Steel Yard, Palais de Tokyo & Nouveau Casino, and I’d love to be considered for future lineups.

Thanks for your time — would love to connect.
